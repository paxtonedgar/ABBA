# MLB Statistical Betting Strategy Analysis

## Overview

The ABBA system uses a comprehensive multi-layered approach to analyze MLB games and determine optimal betting opportunities. Here's how the statistical strategy works when you get a game and all the bets around it:

## 1. Data Collection & Preprocessing

### Statcast Data Integration
- **Pitch-level data**: Velocity, spin rate, movement, location
- **Batted ball data**: Exit velocity, launch angle, barrel percentage
- **Situational data**: Count, runners, inning, score differential
- **Player-specific data**: Recent performance, splits, trends

### Historical Context
- **Last 30-90 days**: Recent form analysis
- **Head-to-head matchups**: Historical performance between teams/players
- **Park factors**: Stadium-specific adjustments
- **Weather conditions**: Impact on ball flight and player performance

## 2. Statistical Analysis Pipeline

### A. Pitching Analysis
```python
# Key metrics analyzed:
- Average velocity and consistency
- Pitch type distribution (fastball %, breaking ball %, offspeed %)
- Spin rate by pitch type
- Strike zone accuracy and edge percentage
- Movement efficiency (horizontal + vertical)
- Pitch quality score (composite metric)
```

### B. Batting Analysis
```python
# Key metrics analyzed:
- Exit velocity and hard-hit percentage
- Barrel percentage (optimal launch angle + exit velocity)
- Launch angle distribution (ground balls, line drives, fly balls)
- Expected batting average (xBA) and expected wOBA (xwOBA)
- Plate discipline (walk rate, strikeout rate)
- Clutch performance (high-leverage situations)
```

### C. Situational Analysis
```python
# Context-specific factors:
- Home vs. away splits
- Day vs. night performance
- Rest days impact
- Bullpen usage patterns
- Lineup construction effects
```

## 3. Machine Learning Model Integration

### Feature Engineering
The system creates 100+ features including:
- **Rolling averages**: 5, 10, 20 game windows
- **Temporal features**: Day of week, month, season progression
- **Interaction features**: Pitcher-batter matchups, park effects
- **Situational features**: Score, inning, count, runners

### XGBoost Model Training
```python
# Model outputs:
- Win probability for each team
- Run line probability
- Total runs probability
- Player-specific performance predictions
```

### SHAP Explainability
- **Feature importance**: Which stats matter most
- **Individual predictions**: Why specific bets are recommended
- **Model interpretability**: Transparent decision-making

## 4. Bet Evaluation Process

### Step 1: Market Analysis
```python
# For each available bet:
1. Extract implied probability from odds
2. Compare with model prediction
3. Calculate expected value (EV)
4. Identify value opportunities
```

### Step 2: Risk Assessment
```python
# Kelly Criterion calculation:
kelly_fraction = (bp - q) / b
where:
- b = odds received - 1
- p = probability of winning
- q = probability of losing (1 - p)
```

### Step 3: Bankroll Management
```python
# Constraints checked:
- Maximum risk per bet (typically 1-5% of bankroll)
- Minimum bankroll preservation
- Portfolio diversification
- Correlation between bets
```

## 5. Decision-Making Framework

### A. Value Betting Strategy
```python
# Minimum thresholds:
- Expected Value > 0.05 (5% edge)
- Kelly fraction > 0.01 (1% of bankroll)
- Model confidence > 0.65
- Sample size > 50 relevant events
```

### B. Bet Types Prioritized

#### 1. Moneyline Bets
- **When to bet**: Strong starting pitcher advantage
- **Key factors**: Pitcher ERA, recent form, park factors
- **Risk level**: Medium

#### 2. Run Line Bets (-1.5/+1.5)
- **When to bet**: Clear team strength differential
- **Key factors**: Run differential, bullpen strength
- **Risk level**: Higher (more variance)

#### 3. Total Runs (Over/Under)
- **When to bet**: Extreme pitching or hitting matchups
- **Key factors**: Park factors, weather, pitcher/hitter trends
- **Risk level**: Medium

#### 4. Player Props
- **When to bet**: Strong statistical advantages
- **Key factors**: Recent form, matchup history, situational factors
- **Risk level**: Variable

### C. Arbitrage Detection
```python
# Cross-platform analysis:
1. Compare odds across multiple books
2. Calculate arbitrage percentage
3. Execute when profit > 1%
4. Consider timing and liquidity
```

## 6. Real-Time Decision Process

### For Each Game:

#### Phase 1: Data Gathering (5-10 minutes)
```python
# Collect:
- Starting lineups
- Recent player stats (last 30 days)
- Weather conditions
- Park factors
- Betting line movements
```

#### Phase 2: Model Prediction (2-3 minutes)
```python
# Generate:
- Win probabilities for both teams
- Expected run totals
- Player performance projections
- Confidence intervals
```

#### Phase 3: Value Analysis (1-2 minutes)
```python
# Evaluate each bet:
- Calculate expected value
- Apply Kelly Criterion
- Check bankroll constraints
- Rank opportunities by EV
```

#### Phase 4: Execution Decision (1 minute)
```python
# Final checks:
- Minimum EV threshold met
- Bankroll constraints satisfied
- Risk management rules followed
- Portfolio diversification maintained
```

## 7. Example Decision Flow

### Scenario: Yankees vs. Red Sox

#### Input Data:
- **Yankees**: Cole starting, 2.50 ERA, 95 mph avg velocity
- **Red Sox**: Rodriguez starting, 4.20 ERA, 92 mph avg velocity
- **Park**: Yankee Stadium (HR-friendly)
- **Weather**: 75Â°F, light wind out to right
- **Line**: Yankees -150, Red Sox +130

#### Analysis:
```python
# Model predictions:
- Yankees win probability: 62.5%
- Red Sox win probability: 37.5%
- Expected total runs: 9.2

# Value calculations:
- Yankees -150: Implied prob = 60%, Our prob = 62.5%, EV = +1.5%
- Red Sox +130: Implied prob = 43.5%, Our prob = 37.5%, EV = -6%
- Over 9.5: Implied prob = 48%, Our prob = 52%, EV = +4%

# Kelly stakes:
- Yankees: 1.2% of bankroll
- Over 9.5: 2.1% of bankroll
- Red Sox: No bet (negative EV)
```

#### Decision:
- **Place bet**: Yankees -150 (1.2% stake)
- **Place bet**: Over 9.5 (2.1% stake)
- **Pass**: Red Sox +130

## 8. Risk Management

### Portfolio Construction
```python
# Guidelines:
- Max 5% on any single bet
- Max 15% on any single game
- Max 25% on any single day
- Diversify across bet types and teams
```

### Stop-Loss Rules
```python
# Triggers:
- Daily loss > 5% of bankroll
- Weekly loss > 15% of bankroll
- Consecutive losses > 8 bets
```

### Model Validation
```python
# Continuous monitoring:
- Track prediction accuracy
- Monitor EV realization
- Adjust thresholds based on performance
- Retrain models monthly
```
