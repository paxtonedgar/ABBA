### Realistic EV Calculation
```python
def calculate_realistic_ev(win_prob, odds, weather_impact, injury_impact):
    # Convert odds to decimal
    odds_decimal = odds_to_decimal(odds)
    
    # Apply weather and injury adjustments
    adjusted_prob = win_prob * (1 + weather_impact) * (1 + injury_impact)
    adjusted_prob = clamp(adjusted_prob, 0.1, 0.9)
    
    # Calculate EV
    ev = (adjusted_prob * (odds_decimal - 1)) - ((1 - adjusted_prob) * 1)
    
    # Apply vig adjustment (typically 4-5%)
    ev *= 0.95
    
    return ev
```

### Weather Impact Calculation
```python
def calculate_weather_impact(weather_data):
    impact = 0.0
    
    # Temperature impact (from bias PDF: +1.3% HR per °C)
    temp = weather_data['temperature']
    if temp > 25:  # Hot weather favors hitters
        impact += (temp - 25) * 0.013
    elif temp < 15:  # Cold weather favors pitchers
        impact -= (15 - temp) * 0.010
    
    # Wind and precipitation impacts
    wind = weather_data['wind_speed']
    precip = weather_data['precipitation']
    
    return impact
```
